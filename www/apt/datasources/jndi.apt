Usage of the JNDI Report Source

  The usage of a JNDI report source is very similar to using JDBC sources,
the main difference is you don't need to stablish the <<<driverClassName>>>
attribute. 

* Configuring the report source

  The attributes required to be used with this type of data soruce are
reflected in the following table:

*-----------------+----------*--------------------------------------------------+
| Attribute       | Optional | Description                                      |
*-----------------+----------*--------------------------------------------------+
| value           | false    | JNDI name of the data source                     |
*-----------------+----------*--------------------------------------------------+
| query           | true     | Query to be used to offer the data to the report |
*-----------------+----------*--------------------------------------------------+

* Examples

** Simple Usage

  This usage of the report source will give to the report a <<<java.sql.Connection>>>
instance. The report must be desgined with a default query.

  The most simple usage consist on stablish the two required attributes:
  
+---
<jr:reportSource id="jndiSource"
	value="jdbc/databasename"
	type="jndi"
/>
+---

** Using queries

  This kind of usage will give to the report a JasperReports' <<<ResultSetDataSource>>>
instance. The report doesn't need to be designed with a default query.

  To use queries with this kind of source you must include the <<<query>>> attribute:
  
+---
<jr:reportSource id="jndiSource" type="jndi"
	value="jdbc/databasename"
	query="select * from orders"
/>
+---

  Also you can use parametriced queries this way:
  
+---
<jr:reportSource id="jndiSource" type="jndi"
	value="jdbc/databasename"
	query="select * from orders where orderId = ?"
>
	<f:param value="23938" />
</jr:reportSource>
