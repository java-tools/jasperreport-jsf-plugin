Getting Started

  Getting started with JasperReports JSF Plugin is very easy, just drop
the jasperreports-jsf.jar file into your application classpath and you
are ready to use it within your application view files.

  Following are some indications you may need to use it depending of the
JSF framework used by your web application.

* Default Usage (JSP's)

  If you are not using any JSF based framework, in other words, your 
application is JSP based you should configure your JSP's to enable
the tag library this way:

+---
<%@ taglib uri="http://jasperreportjsf.sf.net/tld/jasperreports-jsf-1_0.tld" prefix="jr" %>
+---

  After adding the <<<taglib>>> declaration you can add your report component
to the JSF tree at any point you need:

+---
<f:view>
  ...
  
  <jr:report path="..." />
  
  ...
</f:view>
+---

* JSF Facelets

  When using Facelets, the JasperReports JSF Plugin tag library must be
configured using a XML namespace this way:

+---
<html xmlns=".."
      ...
      xmlns:jr="http://jasperreportjsf.sf.net/tld/jasperreports-jsf-1_0.tld"
>
  ...
</html>
+---

  After defining the XML namespace for the plugin you can add the report
component like other HTML content:

+---
<html xmlns="..." xmlns:jr="...">
...
<body>
  ...
  <span jsfc="jr:reportLink" path="...">
    View Report
  </span>
  ...
</body>
<html>
+---

* Apache Shale (Clay views)

  Using JasperReports JSF Plugin with Shale-Clay depends on what kind of views
are you implementing:

    * If you are using JSP based views, you will need to configure the
      tag library like if you were using no JSF framework at all (Default Usage).
      
    * If you are using XHTML based views, you will need to configure the
      XML namespace like if you were using the JSF Facelets framework.
      
    * If you are using HTML based views, you will not need to configure
      any XML / taglib at all.
      
  Using Shale-Clay is very similar to using JSF Facelets, the main difference
is the special attribute needed to stablish wichi JSF component it's related
to a HTML tag. Following is an example:

+---
<html>
...
<body>
  ...
  <span jsfid="jr:reportLink" path="...">
    View Report
  </span>
  ...
</body>
<html>
